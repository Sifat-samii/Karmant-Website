excerpt: "This Bangladeshi underground band raised their voice by meticulously crafting an entire extended play called \"Riot In Uniform\" based on the vigorous road safety movement led by young students in 2018. That student movement turned out to be a critical incident for Karmant as their approach to original compositions was in the making."
