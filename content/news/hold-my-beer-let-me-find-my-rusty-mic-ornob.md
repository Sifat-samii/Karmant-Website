Before we get into the madness, shoutout to Ruzlan Safat — the voice of Karmant since October 2023. We had a hell of a run, tore through gigs, and caused enough chaos to keep the scene interesting. Rangamati was probably the wildest. That trip alone deserves its own documentary. Nothing but love.

Now, back to where it all began.

Almost a decade ago, somewhere in the hills of Khagrachari — in a shady hotel and a fuzz-soaked underground gig — Karmant was born out of chaos, liquor, and questionable life choices.

Zami, drunk as expected, almost dead, decided to form a band right then and there. No members. No plan. Just pure vibes.

Sixty-nine seconds later, he spotted Ornob — calm, quiet, sipping tea like he had it all figured out.

Zami asked him to be the voice of this just-invented band.

Ornob nodded toward some dude talking to himself and said,

"Get the drummer first. Vocalists are everywhere. Drummers? Rare species."

Nine years later, after all the madness music, music and mayhem, the circle's finally complete.

Zami: "Band's still alive. Still weird. Still loud. You in?"

Ornob: "Hold my beer. Let me find my rusty mic."

Ladies and gents, Ashikur Rahman Ornob is officially the voice of Karmant, again. 

Let the chaos resume!
