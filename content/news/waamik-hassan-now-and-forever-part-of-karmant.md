You've seen him on stage with us at the last two shows in Dhaka and Mymensingh. He was in the videos, in the chaos, in the sound. But we never made a post about him before. We held back because deep down we knew this day would come—the day he'd tell us he's flying back.

He came to visit, ended up plugging in, and from the first jam, something just clicked. No ego. No noise. Just heavy riffs, louder laughs, and a bond that locked in fast.

WWamik, even if you're heading far away, your place in this band is sealed. There will always be space for your throat-slicing guitar work and the madness you bring.

Whenever you land next, the rehearsal room will be ready.

Thank you for everything. You're Karmant for life.

Cheers and beers. 🍻
